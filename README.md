Keep in touch with your friends, family, business associates, and anyone else in your iOS Contacts list with CatchUp. Set reminders for the contacts you choose, and get notified when it's time to CatchUp with them again.

Set these up as recurring reminders, like every week or month, or a custom day that you pick. Regardless of your choice, you can choose the time of day that you get the notification.

*Step One*: Add Contacts

*Step Two*: Set your Notification Preference (how often you want to be reminded to catch up with that individual)

*Step Three*: There is no step three

**Features**:
- Full light and dark mode support
- Receive reminders to catch up with your Contacts, even when not connected to the internet
- Customization for nearly every reminder choice
- Automatic reminders for contacts' birthdays/anniversaries if you have them set in your Contacts app before adding them to CatchUp
- No ads

CatchUp is free and has no ads. This is a passion project that honestly helps me out, and I'd rather not muddy the waters with advertising I can't control. If you'd like to support development, you are welcome to leave a tip in the Tip Jar within the app.

**Nerd stuff**:
- 99% of the user interface was built with SwiftUI, the contact picker is the only bridge into UIKit
- All persistence/storage is done with Core Data and all data stays local to your device
- 35% reduction in code from v1.x to v2.x

A note on privacy:
I store NONE of your contacts or any of your personal information. The contacts you choose and the preferences you set for them are stored locally on your device, and are never sent anywhere else. Read my full privacy policy at https://ryantoken.com/privacy-policy
